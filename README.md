## Running tests
In order to run the tests you need `mocha-phantomjs`. You can do it by installing:

```sh
npm install -g mocha-phantomjs
```

After doing that you will need to install the module with npm:

```
npm install .
```

All set you just need to run the tests:
```
mocha-phantomjs test/test.html
```
